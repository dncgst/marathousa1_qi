## Publication abstract

 Recent excavations at the Middle Pleistocene open-air site of Marathousa 1 have unearthed in one of the two investigated area (Area A) a partial skeleton of a single individual of _Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus_ and other faunal remains in spatial and stratigraphic association with lithic artefacts. In Area B, a much higher number of lithic artefacts was collected, spatially and stratigraphically associated with other faunal remains. The two areas are stratigraphically correlated, the main fossiliferous layers representing an _en mass_ depositional process in a lake margin context. Evidence of butchering (cut-marks) has been identified on two bones of the elephant skeleton, as well on other mammal bones from Area B. However, due to the secondary deposition nature of the main find-bearing units, it is of primary importance to evaluate the degree and reliability of the spatial association of the lithic artefacts with the faunal remains. Indeed, spatial association does not necessarily imply causation. The present study uses a comprehensive set of multiscale and multivariate spatial statistics, in order to disentangle the depositional processes behind the distribution of the archaeological and palaeontological record at Marathousa 1. Moving beyond maps, statistical inference allows for a better interpretation of spatial patterns by adopting a more inductive and reproducible strategy. Moreover, within a frame of references, it enables us to depict the underlying processes responsible for the observed patterns, and to quantify the extent of the post-depositional reworking processes which have long been recognised to affect the integrity of archaeological assemblages. Assessing the degree of disturbance is crucial to fully comprehend the archaeological record, and therefore to reliably interpret past human behaviours. Preliminary results of our analyses suggest minor reworking and substantial spatial association of the lithic and faunal assemblages, supporting the current interpretation of Marathousa 1 as a butchering site.
