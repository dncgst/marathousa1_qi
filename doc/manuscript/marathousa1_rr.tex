  \begin{abstract}
    Recent excavations at the Middle Pleistocene open-air site of Marathousa~1 have unearthed in one of the two investigated areas (Area A) a partial skeleton of a single individual of \emph{Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus} and other faunal remains in spatial and stratigraphic association with lithic artefacts. In Area B, a much higher number of lithic artefacts was collected, spatially and stratigraphically associated with other faunal remains. The two areas are stratigraphically correlated, the main fossiliferous layers representing an \emph{en mass} depositional process in a lake margin context. Evidence of butchering (cut-marks) has been identified on two bones of the elephant skeleton, as well on other mammal bones from Area B. However, due to the secondary deposition of the main find-bearing units, it is of primary importance to evaluate the degree and reliability of the spatial association of the lithic artefacts with the faunal remains. Indeed, spatial association does not necessarily imply causation, since natural syn- and post-depositional processes may equally produce spatial association. Assessing the degree and extent of post-depositional reworking processes is crucial to fully comprehend the archaeological record, and therefore to reliably interpret past human behaviours. The present study uses a comprehensive set of spatial statistics in order to disentangle the depositional processes behind the distribution of the archaeological and palaeontological record at Marathousa~1. Results of our analyses suggest minor reworking and substantial spatial association of the lithic and faunal assemblages, supporting the current interpretation of Marathousa~1 as a butchering site.

\section{Introduction}

%% Theoretical framework: site formation processes & spatial statistics
Archaeological site formation processes, intensively studied since the early 1970s \citep[][among others]{Isaac1967,Schiffer1972,Schiffer1983,Schiffer1987,Shackley1978,Wood1978,Schick1984,Schick1986,Schick1987,Petraglia1987,Petraglia1994} %add Binford1981a,Binford1987,Binford1977,1980,1981???
, ``still insufficiently taken in consideration'' \citep{Texier2000} at the beginning of the 21st century, are nowadays fully acknowledged in the archaeological practice \citep[][among others]{Villa2004,Bailey2007,Brantingham2007,Malinsky-Buller2011,Vaquero2012,Bargallo2016}. %add more ref
Drawing inferences about past human behaviours from scatters of archaeological remains must account for syn- and post-depositional contextual processes.

Several methods are currently applied in order to qualify and quantify the type and degree of reworking of archaeological assemblages. Within the framework of a geoarchaeological and taphonomic approach, spatial statistics offer meaningful contributions in unravelling site formation and modification processes from spatial patterns. However, while the spatio-temporal dimension is an ineluctable inherent property of any biotic or abiotic process, spatial statistics are still insufficiently applied.

% Beside fabric, vertical distribution...

Distribution maps are cornerstones of the archaeological documentation process and are primary analytic tools %, ordinarly used in site formation studies
. However, their visual interpretation is prone to subjectivity and is not reproducible \citep{Bevan2013a}. Since the early 1970's (see \cite{Hodder1976,Orton1982} and references therein), the traditional, intuitive, `eyeballing' method of spotting spatial patterns has been abandoned in favour of more objective approaches, extensively borrowed from other fields. Nevertheless, quantitative methods, while still percolating in the archaeological sciences from neighbouring disciplines, are not extensively used. Moreover, only a relatively small number of studies have explicitly applied spatial point pattern analysis or geostatistics to the study of site formation and modification processes (\cite{Lenoble2008,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014b,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014c,Dominguez-Rodrigo2017,Carrer2015,Giusti2016,Organista2017} - but see \cite{Hivernel1984} for an earlier work on the subject). % add cluster analysis?

%% Rationale
The goal of a taphonomic approach to spatial analysis is to move beyond distribution maps by applying a comprehensive set of multiscale and multivariate spatial statistics in order to reliably construct inferences from spatial patterns. An exhaustive spatial analytic approach to archaeological inference, combined with a taphonomic perspective, is essential for evaluating the depositional processes and integrity of the archaeological assemblage, and consequently for a reliable interpretation of past human behaviours.

%% Object
The present study uses a comprehensive set of spatial statistics (fabric, vertical distribution and point pattern analyses) in order to disentangle the depositional processes behind the spatial distribution of the archaeological and palaeontological record recovered during excavation at the Middle Pleistocene open-air site of Marathousa~1, Megalopolis, Greece \citep{Panagopoulou2015,Harvati2016}.

\subsection{Marathousa~1}

%% Geographical location and geological framework
The site (Fig.~\ref{fig:1}), discovered in 2013 at the edge of an active lignite quarry (Thompson et al., this issue), is located between two lignite seams in the Pleistocene deposits of the Megalopolis basin, Marathousa Member of the Choremi Formation \citep{Vugt2000}. The regular alternation of lacustrine clay, silt and sand beds with lignite seams has been interpreted having cyclic glacial (or stadial) and interglacial (or interstadial) origin \citep{Nickel1996}. The half-graben configuration of the basin, with major subsidence along the NW-SE trending normal faults along the eastern margin, resulted in the gentle dip of the lake bottom at the opposite, western, margin of the lake, enabling the formation of swamps and the accumulation of organic material for prolonged periods of time \citep{Vugt2000}.

  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

%% Archaeological material
Two excavation areas have been investigated since 2013: Area A, where several skeletal elements of a single individual of \emph{Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus} have been unearthed, together with a number of lithic artefacts (Konidaris et al., this issue; Tourloukis et al., this issue); and Area B, located 60 m to the South along the exposed section, where the lithic assemblage is richer and occurs in association with a faunal assemblage composed of isolated elephant bones, cervids and carnivores among others (Fig.~\ref{fig:2}). Evidence of butchering (cut-marks) have been identified on two of the elephant bones from Area A, as well on elephant and other mammal bones from Area B (Konidaris et al., this issue).

%   \caption{Distribution maps of the remains in Area A () and Area B ().}
%   \label{fig:2}
% \end{figure}

%% Stratigraphic framework
The sedimentary sequence of the site (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}) includes lacustrine and fluvio-lacustrine clastic deposits between lignite seams II (UA7-UB10) and III (UA1-UB1) (Karkanas et al., Tourloukis et al., this issue). A major hiatus (UA3/4, UB5/6), attributed to exposure and erosion of a lake shore mudflat, divides the sequence in two parts. The lower part is characterized by high rate subaqueous sedimentation of bedded sands and silts; while the upper one is characterized by a series of erosional bounded depositional units, attributed to subaerial organic- and carbonate-rich mudflows and hyperconcentrated flows (Karkanas et al., this issue).

\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../artwork/Fig3.pdf}
  \caption{Stratigraphic setting of the Marathousa~1 site, modified after Karkanas et al. (this issue).}
  \label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

The erosional contacts UA3c/4 and UB4c/5a separate the two main find-bearing units in both areas. In Area A, the elephant remains lie at the contact of UA3c/4 and are covered by UA3c (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}a); while in Area B, most of the remains were collected from unit UB4c (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}b). Units UA3c and UB4c (organic-rich, intraclast-rich silty sands) resemble diluite mudflows, showing a chaotic structure of rip-up clasts from the underlying unit, small-to-large wood fragments, and rare rock clasts. In Area B, a relatively low number of remains was also found in massive organic-rich silty sands (UB5a), which locally overlay channalized sands (UB5b/c), probably not preserved in Area A (Karkanas et al., this issue).

\begin{figure}[]

  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../artwork/Fig4.jpg}
  \caption{Photograph (2017) of the left femur of the \emph{Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus}, lying at the contact of UA3c/4 and covered by UA3c (a). South profile (2015) of the excavation Area B, exposing the UB4c/5a erosional contact (b).}
  \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}

The flow event described above (units UA3c and UB4c), and specifically the erosional contacts between the fossiliferous horizons in the two areas (UA3c/4 and UB4c/5a), provide the essential background for the analysis and interpretation of the spatial distributions at Marathousa~1.

%% Main research question!
The secondary depositional nature of the main find horizons raises the question of how reliable is the spatial association between the lithic artefacts and the partial skeleton of a single \emph{Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus} individual and other faunal remains. Since spatial association does not necessarily imply causation, and consequently synchrony \citep{Binford1981a,Binford1987}, the answer has important consequences for the interpretation of the site in the broader context of the Middle Pleistocene human-proboscidean interactions. We aim to tackle this question and disentangle the formation processes acting at Marathousa~1 on the basis of spatial patterns through a three-prong spatial analytic approach:
\begin{enumerate}
\item by analysing, in a frame of references, the orientation patterns of remains from relevant stratigraphic units;
\item by quantifying and comparing their relative vertical distributions;
\item by identifying spatial trends in either the assemblage intensities and the associations between classes of remains.
\end{enumerate}

%% Hypothesis testing
For both areas, the working hypothesis is that the flow event, represented by units UA3c and UB4c, eroded and scoured the exposed surface (where the elephant was lying), thereby entraining clastic material (including probably artefacts) and re-depositing this material at a close distance. Two contrasting models are tested. The autochthonous model \citep[][sensu]{Dominguez-Rodrigo2012} states that a post-depositional process (namely the UA3-UB4 flow) reworked \emph{on site} the assemblage and altered the original, pristine \emph{in situ} deposition. This model implies the loss of any original spatial relations between remains, but minor transport from the primary depositional \emph{loci} and re-deposition \citep[][sensu]{Fernandez-Lopez}. On the other hand, the allochthonous model \citep[][sensu]{Dominguez-Rodrigo2012} implies significant transport from the original \emph{loci} and re-elaboration \citep[][sensu]{Fernandez-Lopez}. According to this model, the spurious spatial association between the lithic artefacts and faunal remains does not support any behavioural interpretation.

\section{Material and methods}

%% Excavation protocol
Since 2013, systematic investigation of the Marathousa~1 site has been carried out by a joint team from the Ephoreia of Palaeoanthropology-Speleology (Greek Ministry of Culture) and the University of Tübingen. A grid system of 1 square meter units was set up, oriented -14 degrees off the magnetic North, and including the two areas of investigation. The excavation of the deposit proceeded in 50x50~cm sub-squares in Area B and 1x1~m squares in Area A, and spits of 5 to 10~cm thickness, respectively. Systematic water-screening of sediments was carried out on-site using 1~mm sieves in order to guarantee recovery of the small-size fraction (e.g., micro-artefacts, small mammal remains, fish, molluscs and small fragments of organic and inorganic material). The three-dimensional coordinates of finds (i.e., all the lithic artefacts, teeth and diagnostic bones; bones and organic material with a-axis $\geq20$~mm), collected spits of sediment, samples and geological features (e.g., erosional contacts and mud cracks) were recorded with a Total Station. Dense clouds of surface points of the Elephant skeletal elements were acquired using both a Total Station and a close-range photogrammetric technique. %No drawings were ... due to the salvage excavation conducted at Marathousa 1.

The dimensions (length, width and thickness) of registered finds were measured on-site with millimetre rules. Orientation (dip and strike) of elongated particles (i.e., faunal remains, large wood fragments and lithic artefacts) was recorded since 2013 with a 30~degree accuracy, using a clock-like system (the strike was measured, relatively to the grid North, in twelve clockwise intervals). In 2015, the use of a compass and inclinometer with an accuracy of 1~degree was introduced in Area B to gradually replace the former method.

The widespread use of a compass and inclinometer to record orientation data \citep[][among others]{Voorhies1966,Bertran1995,Bertran1997,Lenoble2004,Eberth2007,Eren2010,Benito-Calvo2011a,Dominguez-Rodrigo2012,Dominguez-Rodrigo2013,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014,Cobo-Sanchez2014,Organista2017} was favoured over the alternative use of a total station \citep[][among others]{Kluskens1990,Dibble1997,McPherron2005,Enloe2006,Bernatchez2010}, mostly due to the time-restricted conditions of the rescue excavation conducted at Marathousa 1.

Measurements of the strike (azimuth) and dip of eleongated finds were taken along the symmetrical longitudinal a-axis (SLA) of bones \citep{Dominguez-Rodrigo2013}, lithic artefacts \citep{Bertran1995} and organic material, using the lowest endpoint of the axis as an indicator of the vector direction.

Other major axes have been alternatively used with the recent application of GIS techniques to retrieve orientation data from secondary source (i.e., excavation photographs or maps) \citep{Boschian2010,Benito-Calvo2011,Torre2013a,Walter2013,Garcia-Moreno2016,Sanchez-Romero2016}. % problems with not clearly elongated items...
However, the experimental works of \cite{Dominguez-Rodrigo2013} and \cite{Dominguez-Rodrigo2014} showed that the SLA, defined as the major axis which symmetrically divide the bone, is more accurate in determining the preferential orientation of anisotropic assemblages. This a-axis is commonly used in taphonomic studies \citep[][among others]{Toots1965,Voorhies1969,Ebert2007,Dominguez-Rodrigo2012,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014c,Aramendi2017} % because...
and not explicitly define, but commonly refer to it as the clast/artefact long or major axis, in studies which employ a sedimentological approach to archaeological fabric \citep[][among others]{Bertran1995,Bertran1997,Lenoble2004,Benito-Calvo2009}. %Moreover, GIS techniques should not substitute primary field observations \citep{Torre2013a}.

%% Material/areas object of analysis
The present study focuses on the excavated stratigraphic units in which most of the archaeological and palaeontological remains were recovered in both excavation areas, namely in UA3c and UA4 in Area A, and UB4c and UB5a in Area B. From the total, subset samples of material were used for each specific spatial analysis. For the fabric analysis we included material collected until 2016. For the vertical distribution and point pattern analyses, the region of investigation was limited to the squares excavated from 2013 until 2015, 25 and 29 square meters respectively in each area.

%% Reproducible research
The analyses were performed in \textsf{R} statistical software \citep{RCoreTeam2016}. In order to make this research reproducible \citep{Marwick2017,Marwick2017a}, a repository containing a compendium of data, source code and text is open licensed and available at the DOI: \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.822273}{10.5281/zenodo.822273}

\subsection{Fabric analysis}

%% Intro
The study of the clast fabric (i.e., the orientation pattern of elongated sedimentary particles, including bones and artefacts), first addressed by \cite{Voorhies1966,Isaac1967,Bar-Yosef1972,Schick1986}, more recently led to a noteworthy development of methods and propagation of applications in Palaeolithic site formation studies \citep[][among others]{Bertran1995,Bertran1997,Lenoble2004,Lenoble2008,McPherron2005,Benito-Calvo2009,Benito-Calvo2011a,Benito-Calvo2011,Bernatchez2010,Boschian2010,Dominguez-Rodrigo2012,Dominguez-Rodrigo2013,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014,Torre2013a,Walter2013,Garcia-Moreno2016,Sanchez-Romero2016}.

Fabric analysis can provide valuable insight into site formation and taphonomic processes, allowing to discriminate between orientation patterns (isotropic, linear or planar) associated with different sedimentary processes. Nevertheless, grey zones exist between depositional processes, so that an unequivocal discrimination based only on fabric observations is often not possible, and other taphonomic criteria must also be considered \citep{Lenoble2004}.

As part of our three-prong spatial analytic approach, we conducted comparative fabric analysis with the aim to investigate the dynamics of the depositional processes at Marathousa~1.

%% Assumptions & Expectations
At the margin of a lacustrine environment, relatively close to the surrounding relief, a combination of high- and low-energy processes can be expected. According to the depositional context of the site (Karkanas et al., this issue), %mud/hyperconcentrated flows 
 
% LINEAR: a strong preferred orientation of clasts (linear pattern) would suggest the action of massive slope processes such as mudslides and debris / hyperconcentrated flows.
% On the other hand, whereas the frontal lobes of debris flows have been found to show a more random orientation (isotropic pattern),
% PLANAR: overland flows have been associated with planar fabrics \citep{Lenoble2004}.
% ANISOTROPY: Conversely, in a lacustrine floodplain, anisotropy without significant transport can be caused by low-energy processes such as lake transgression and regression, as well as water-sheet flows formed during rainy seasons. Isotropic patterns have been observed in different parts of mudflats as well \citep{Cobo-Sanchez2014}.

%% Subsets
Since fabric strength has been found to be positively correlated with the shape and size of the clast, for the fabric analysis we subset samples of remains with length $\geq2$~cm and elongation index (the ratio length/width) $I_{e}\geq1.6$ \citep{Lenoble2004}. The samples are listed in Table~\ref{tab:1} and include mostly wood fragments % assuming wood acts like bones...
and faunal remains from the four stratigraphic units under investigation. %"Bones react more efficiently to water flow than lithics and tend to show very early anisotropic patterns \citep{Schick1984,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014}
No distinction of skeletal elements was made, both due to the high fragmentation rate of faunal remains in Area B, and because recent experiments showed a similar orientation pattern for different bone shapes \citep{Dominguez-Rodrigo2012,Dominguez-Rodrigo2013}. %Dominguez-Rodrigo2014

The sample of bones belonging to the individual of \emph{Elephas (P.) antiquus} from Area A was analysed separately and included the humerus, ulna, femur and tibia; the atlas, axis and 16 complete vertebrae or vertebral fragments; 29 complete ribs or rib fragments; 2 calcanea; 4 metatarsals/metacarpals; the pyramidal; the trapezoid and the pelvis. The sample from UB5a was too small (only 7 observations) and was therefore excluded. The sample from the UB4c unit was divided in two sub-samples considered separately: those recorded using the clock method and those recorded using the compass method. All the sampled observations are representative of the whole study area.

% In order to asses the reliability of the orientation data from Area A, recorded using the clock method, a non-parametric Watson's two-sample test was conducted on a subset of data from Area B (unit UB4c) recorded using both the compass and clock method. The test failed to reject the null hypothesis that two samples (clock- and compass-based measurements) belong to the same parent population ($U^2=0.1097, p-value>0.10$). Although the difference between the two sample is not quantified, the Woodcock and Benn diagrams showed little difference between the two distributions (see SI)

  }
\end{table}

%% Methods
Rose diagrams and uniformity tests, such as Rayleigh, Kuiper, Watson and Rao tests \citep{Jammalamadaka2001}, were used to visualise and evaluate circular isotropy in the sample distribution. The Rayleigh test is used to assess the significance of the sample mean resultant length ($\bar{R}$), assuming that the distribution is unimodal and not bi- or plurimodal. The $\bar{R}$ ranges from 0 to 1: values close to 1 indicate that the data are closely clustered around the mean direction; when the data are evenly spread $\bar{R}$ has a value close to 0. A $p-value$ lower than 0.05 rejects the hypothesis of randomness with a 95\% confidence interval. Kuiper, Watson and Rao are omnibus tests used to detect multimodal departures from circular uniformity. %All of them were applied using a significance level of $alpha=0.01$.
The test results are evaluated against critical values: a result higher than the critical value rejects the null hypothesis of isotropy.%with a 99\% confidence interval.

Randomness testing of three-dimensional data was conducted with the Woodcock $S_1/S_3$ test \citep{Woodcock1983}. Considering both the dip (plunge) and strike (bearing) of the oriented items, this method, based on three ordered eigenvalues ($S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$), is able to discriminate the shape and strength of the distributions. The shape parameter $K=\frac{ln(S_1/S_2)}{ln(S_2/S_3)}$ ranges from zero (uni-axial girdles) to infinite (uni-axial clusters). The parameter $C=ln(S_1/S_3)$ expresses the strength of the preferential orientation, and its significance is evaluated against critical values from simulated random samples of different sizes. A perfect random uniform distribution would have $C=0$ and $K=1$.

The Benn \citep{Benn1994} diagram adds to the Woodcock test an isotropy ($IS=S_3/S_1$) and an elongation ($ES=1-(S_2/S_1)$) index. Like the former method, it is able to differentiate between linear (cluster), planar (girdle) or isotropic distributions. There are no published raw data from actualistic studies on depositional processes affecting the orientation of bones and artefacts deposited on lacustrine floodplains (but see \cite{Morton2004} and \cite{Cobo-Sanchez2014} as pioneer studies on this subject). However, we included in the Benn diagram references to published results from observation of fabrics in modern subaereal slope deposits \citep{Bertran1997,Lenoble2004}, which include debris flow, runoff and solifluction.

\subsection{Vertical distribution}

%% Intro
The vertical distribution of materials has been long investigated with the aim of identifying cultural levels, by visually interpreting cross-sectional plots. However, recent advances in GIS techniques allow to inspect at higher resolution the three-dimensional distributions of archaeological remains \citep[][among others]{McPherron2005a,Anderson2008}

% , quantitative approaches are still not extensively used - but see \cite{Anderson2008}. % Moreover, archaeological horizons may be subject to vertical rearrangement by syn- and post-depositional processes. Several experimental studies, for example, have investigated the effect of trampling on the vertical displacement of artefacts \citep{Villa1983a,Gifford-Gonzalez1985,Nielsen1991,Eren2010}. % Although these works have reported a negative correlation between artefact size and vertical displacement, particle size sorting of lithic assemblages, when exposed to physical geomorphic agents (such as gravity, water flow, waves and tides, wind), has been widely documented \citep{Rick1976,Schick1986,Petraglia1987,Morton2004,Lenoble2005,Bertran2012}. %A spatial analysis of particle size sorting is yet rare (Dominguez-Rodrigo) % aeolian sorting biblio?

%% Assumptions & Expectations
In analysing the vertical dispersion of material at Marathousa 1, we provisionally assume that a general concentration of unsorted lithic artefacts and faunal remains in the proximity of the erosional surfaces would support an autochthonous origin of the assemblages; whereas a homogeneous vertical distribution of remains from the UA3c and UB4c units would suggest an allochthonous origin, significant transport and subsequent redeposition of the material. Indeed, massive process, such as mud- or hyperconcentrated flows, have high erosional power and rather chaotic structure, which would result in homogeneous dispersion of embedded clasts throughout the sequence. However, graded bedding could result in such fluid depositional environments, associated with a decrease in transport energy \citep{}.

%% Subsets
In order to estimate the degree of vertical dispersion while controlling for the size of the archaeological material, dimensional classes were set up following typological criteria. Lithic artefacts were classified as debris/chips when smaller than a cutoff length of 15~mm (see Tourloukis et al., this issue). Other classes include flakes, tools and cores; the latter being the bigger and heavier debitage product. Table~\ref{tab:2} summarises the sample size for each class. Lithic debris/chips constitutes the larger part of the assemblages from UB4c (60\%) and UB5a (49\%); whereas in Area A it represents only a moderate percentage in the upper UA3c unit (16\%). The very rare presence of lithic artefacts in the underlying unit UA4 is nevertheless significant. In this unit, the faunal remains are also found in much lower numbers, their number reduced to one fourth of those found in UA3c. For the point pattern analysis (see below), we used the same subset of materials for both excavation areas.

%% Methods
For Area B, the material recovered from the water-screening was randomly provenanced according to the 5~cm depth of the excavated spit and the coordinates of the 50x50~cm quadrant of the excavation square. Following the same excavation protocol, the same procedure was applied for the water-screened material of Area A, which was randomly provenanced according to 3D-coordinates of the 1x1~m excavation square and 10~cm spit.

Ordinary Kriging interpolation of the recorded points of contact between the UB4c and UB5a stratigraphic units were used to reconstruct the UB4c/5a erosional surface, in Areas B (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}a). In geostatistics, Kriging regression is a parametric method of interpolation which assumes spatial autocorrelation and calculates, from a set of known points, weighted values of unknown points. Thus, in order to address our specific objective, i.e., to quantify and analyse the vertical distribution of the archaeological and palaeontological material, we measured the minimum orthogonal distance of each specimen to the interpolated erosional surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}b). For the units above and below this surface (i.e., UB4c and UB5a), the relative distribution of lithic classes and faunal remains was informally tested by means of kernel density estimations.

In Area A, %where the UA3c/4 erosional surface is rather mixed than sharp, and the elephant lies at that contact,
the relative vertical distribution of remains was estimated relative to the absolute elevation of the elephant remains. Finally, a Student's two sample t-test allowed us to compare the empirical distributions of different groups of remains for each stratigraphic unit.

\subsection{Point pattern analysis}

%% Intro
A spatial point pattern is defined as the outcome of a random spatial point process (repetitions of it would always create a different pattern). The observed patterns of the archaeological and palaeontological remains were treated as manifestations of spatial point processes, i.e., site formation processes. Point pattern analysis investigates the spatial arrangement of points with the aim of identifying spatial trends. In order to integrate the previous studies of the fabric and vertical distributions, we directed our point pattern analysis equally to the intensity of the patterns (the rate of occurrence of the recorded finds) and to the spatial interaction between different types of finds.

%% Methods + Assumptions & Expectations
As the average number of random points per unit area, intensity informs about homogeneity or inhomogeneity in the distribution of events generated by a point process, i.e., whether the rate of occurrence is uniform or spatially varying across the study area. Intensity, usually non-parametrically evaluated by means of kernel density estimation \citep{Diggle1985}, was assessed for the distribution of material from the UB4c, UB5a and UA3c units. Cross-validation bandwidth, which assumes a Cox process, and edge correction were applied using the methods described in \cite{Diggle1985}.

In the presence of a covariate, it is recommended to further investigate the dependence of intensity on that explanatory variable. In order to evaluate whether variation in the density of materials was correlated to the topography of the erosional surface, we computed a local likelihood smoothing estimate of the intensity of remains from UB4c as a function of the UB4c/5a surface elevation model \citep{Baddeley2012}. Formal tests enabled us to assess the evidence of that dependence and to quantify the strength of the covariate. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of CSR (Complete Spatial Randomness) and Berman's $Z_2$ statistics were used to test the strength of evidence for a covariate effect. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), closely related to Berman's $Z_2$ test, measure the magnitude of the covariate effect. AUC values close to 1 or 0 indicate strong discrimination, whereas intermediate values (0.5) suggest no discrimination power.

Whereas intensity is a first-order property of the point process, multiscale inter-point interaction is measured by second or higher-order moment quantities, such as the Ripley's $K$ correlation function \citep{Ripley1976,Ripley1977} and the distance $G$-, $F$- and $J$-functions. Three different types of inter-point interaction are possible: random, regular or cluster. Regular patterns are assumed to be the result of inhibition processes, while cluster patterns are the result of attraction processes. In order to reduce the edge effect bias in estimating the correlation between points, we implemented Ripley's isotropic edge correction \citep{Ohser1983,Ripley1988}. In a hypothesis-testing framework, pointwise envelopes were computed by 199 random simulations of the null hypothesis. Thus, values of the empirical distribution (black solid line) were plotted against the benchmark value (red dotted line) and the envelopes (grey area) which specify the critical points for a Monte Carlo test \citep{Ripley1981}.

In order to test the spatial dependence between remains associated with the erosional event of UB4c and those associated with the underlying UB5a unit, we treated the data as a multivariate point pattern, assuming that the point patterns in UB4c and UB5a are expressions of two different stationary point processes, i.e., depositional events. We performed a cross-type pair correlation function ($g_{ij}(r)$), derivative of the multitype $K_{ij}(r)$ function, which is the expected number of points of type $j$ lying at a distance $r$ of a typical point of type $i$. The function is a multiscale measurement of the spatial dependence between types $i$ (UB4c) and $j$ (UB5a). Randomly shifting each of the two patterns, independently of each other, estimated values of $\hat{g}_{ij}(r)$ are compared to a benchmark value $g_{ij}(r)=1$, which is consistent with independence or at least with lack of correlation between the two point processes.

In addition to the pair correlation function, the multitype nearest-neighbour $G_{ij}(r)$ function was used to estimate the cumulative distribution of the distance from a point of type $i$ (UB4c) to the nearest point of type $j$ (UB5a). It measures the spatial association between the two assemblages. For the cross-type $G$-function, the null hypothesis states that the points of type $j$ follow a Poisson (random) distribution in addition to being independent of the points of type $i$. Thus, in a randomisation technique, when the solid line of the observed distribution ($\hat{G}_{ij}(r)$) is above or below the shaded grey area, the pattern is significantly consistent with clustering or segregation, respectively. Complete spatial randomness and independence (CSRI) of the two point processes would support an exogenous origin hypothesis for the assemblage recovered from the UB4c unit. On the other hand, positive or negative association can be interpreted as expression of different endogenous processes.

The particle size spatial distribution of the lithic assemblage from UB4c was investigated by means of a transformation of the multitype $K$-function ($K_{i\bullet}(r)-K(r)$, see \cite{spatstatBook},p.608). In this case, we treated the data as the manifestation of a single multitype point process. In a joint distribution analysis, the locations and types of points are assumed to be generated at the same time. The null model of a random labelling test states that the type of each point is determined at random, independently of other points, with fixed probabilities. The estimated $K$-function for a subset of possible combinations was evaluated against the envelope of Monte Carlo permutations of the class of remains. Likewise with the vertical distribution, a horizontal clustering of small specimens, such as lithic debris/chips, together with larger dimensional classes of remains would suggest the lack of sorting by natural depositional processes and a \emph{en mass} model of deposition.

As for the three-dimensional distribution of the lithic artefacts in Area A, and their spatial association with the partial skeleton of the \emph{E. (P.) antiquus}, we applied three-dimensional univariate and bivariate second-order functions. A rectangular box of 20 square meters and 80~cm vertical extent was selected for the analyses (green outline in Fig.~\ref{fig:9}a). Assuming homogeneity, the univariate pair correlation function ($g_3(r)$) was estimated for the pattern of all the artefacts (mostly debris/chips) from UA3c and UA4. In the specific context of the site, complete spatial randomness (CSR) would suggest that the pattern most probably is the result of a random distribution process, such as a high energy mass movement. In contrast, other natural processes would produce clustering or segregation of the lithic artefacts. Spatial aggregation, if not generated by obstructions, would support an \emph{in situ} primary origin of the assemblage.

In support to the pair correlation function, the cross-type nearest-neighbour function has been applied in order to compute, for each artefact recovered from the UA3c and UA4 units, the nearest point associated with the elephant skeleton. A prevalence of short distances would indicate aggregation of the lithic artefacts around the mass of the elephant; whereas a uniform or symmetric distribution would support random independent processes.

%% Intro

%% Rose/equal area diagrams & uniformity tests
The rose diagrams in Fig.~\ref{fig:4} visualise the circular distributions of the examined specimens. Overall, the UA4 sample and the sample of elephant bones show predominant peaks in the NE quadrant; while the ones from units UA3c and UB4c suggest uniform to multimodal distributions. Specifically, the UA4 sample distribution (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}b) spreads largely in the NE quadrant. Similarly, the circular distribution of the elephant sample (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}c), mainly lying in UA4, resembles the former distribution: it is skewed to the SW and concentrated in the NE quadrant. On the other hand, the UA3c sample (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}a) and the two samples from Area B (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}d,e) suggest a different isotropic scenario.

Table~\ref{tab:3} summarises the results of the circular uniformity tests.
% UA3c -- Mean direction: 77.17° (E), circular variance: 41.95°; Mean dip: 20.35°, variance: 4.36°
With regard to the UA3c sample, the Rayleigh test ($p-value=0.029$) rejected the null hypothesis of circular uniformity. The mean resultant length ($\bar{R}=0.268$) and the mean direction of 77.17° are thus significant, assuming the distribution is unimodal. However, the Kuiper, Watson and Rao omnibus tests also rejected the null hypothesis of uniformity, therefore suggesting multimodal anisotropy in the distribution, as shown by the rose diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}a).

% UA4 -- Mean direction: 35.79° (N-NE), circular variance: 35.19°; Mean dip: 11.36°, variance: 2.15°
% Elephant (skeleton) 43 obs -- Mean direction: 64.49° (NE), circular variance: 27.89°; Mean plunge: 10.68°, variance: 1.66°
% Elephas (skeleton) 63 obs -- Mean direction: 54.64° (NE), circular variance: 29.25°; Mean plunge: 10.99°, variance: 3.13°
For the UA4 sample and the subset of elephant bones, all the tests agreed in rejecting the null hypothesis in favour of a preferentially oriented distribution. The Elephant sample, with respect to the other, showed stronger anisotropy and significantly higher $\bar{R}$. As suggested by the rose diagrams (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}c), this sample has a mean direction towards the NE (55°) and relatively low circular variance (29°).

% UB4c_clock -- Mean direction: 83.96° (E), circular variance: 47.72° (); Mean dip: 36.14°, variance: 6.20°
% UB4c_comp -- Mean direction: 128.14° (SE), circular variance: 44.41° (); Mean dip: 25.26°, variance: 2.77°
The UB4c sub-samples had discordant test results when considering the Rayleigh and the omnibus statistics. According to the Rayleigh test, the mean resultant length ($\bar{R}$) and the mean direction were not significant for the sub-sample of measurements recorded with the clock system. Conversely, a weak significant test result was obtained for the sub-sample of measurements recorded using the compass. Overall, for the latter sub-sample all the omnibus tests suggested significant isotropy (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}e). On the other hand, the Kuiper and Rao tests, suggested a multimodal departure from uniformity for the sample recorded using the clock method (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}d).

The results obtained for the UA3c sample and the UB4c sub-sample recorded using the clock method are most probably due to the shape of those distributions. Indeed, the clock system, being less accurate, tends to produce a less dense distribution, more subject to show a multimodal shape when the distribution is actually uniform (Fig.~\ref{fig:4}a, d).

%% Woodcock diagram
The Woodcock eigenvalues ratio graph (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}a) presents the shape ($K$) and strength ($C$) of the distributions. Fig.~\ref{fig:5}b plots confidence levels of Monte-Carlo critical $C$ values, varying for sample sizes. The two samples from Area B, together with the UA3c sample, having low $C$ values, plotted close to the origin of the ratio graph. Thus, they suggest nearly significant randomness. On the other hand, the UA4 and the elephant samples, with higher $C$ values, showed a stronger and significant tendency to orient preferentially. The shape parameter $K$ of the samples varied from $K=0.7$ for the UB4c sample measured with the compass to $K=0.1$ for the elephant sample. Overall, all the samples plotted below the average shape value ($K=1$) between girdles and clusters distributions.

\end{figure}

%% Benn diagram
The Benn diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:6}) resembles the Woodcock ratio graph (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}a). The samples from units UB4c and UA3c clearly plotted at a distance from the UA4 and the elephant samples. The UB4c sub-sample of measurements recorded with the compass, together with the UA3c sample, plotted in the centre of the ternary graph. As shown above, the UB4c sub-sample of measurements taken using the clock system exhibited more isotropy.

Compared to the ranges recorded for modern natural processes (debris flow, runoff, solifluction), the fabric from the UA3c and UB4c units plotted well inside the cluster of debris flows, with the UB4c (clock) sample suggesting even more random orientations. On the other hand, the sample of elephant remains, which lie mostly on UA4 and are covered by UA3c, plotted significantly close to the sample from unit UA4. They both presented the lowest isotropy index ($IS$), but not high elongation index ($EL$). Thus, they plotted in the average between linear and planar orientations, within the range of runoff processes. Yet they still plotted at the margins of the cluster of debris flows fabrics. Moreover, the elphant sample showed a more planar attitude with respect to the UA4 sample.

\subsection{Vertical distribution}

%% Intro

%\subsubsection{Area A}

%% UA3c/4c
Fig.~\ref{fig:7} compares the distribution of the absolute elevations of the partial skeleton of the \emph{Elephas (P.) antiquus} with the other remains from Area A. Overall, the vertical distribution of the elephant approximates a normal distribution with mean ($\mu$) 349.25~m a.s.l. and standard deviation ($\sigma$) 0.12~m. The mean elevation of the erosional contact between the two stratigraphic units is slightly above the latter ($\mu=349.30$~m). Although difficult to quantify due to its mixed nature, the range of elevations of this contact, as estimated from the IDW interpolation (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}a), is relatively small ($\sigma=0.06$~m).

Three lithic artefacts (two flakes and one tool) from the UA3c unit are located within its positive half. Only one flake has been found in the lower UA4, at about 349.10~m, together with three chips. However, they plotted well within the left tail of the debris/chip distribution from the unit above. Despite the scarcity of debitage products in this area, waste products (debris/chip) are relatively well represented (16\% of the UA3c sample). Their vertical distribution approximates a normal distribution ($\mu=349.50$~m and $\sigma=0.18$~m), having almost 50\% of the sample in the range of elevations of the erosional surface and the rest above it. Notably, the distribution of the faunal remains from the same unit resembles that of the debris/chip. The Welch two sample t-test ($p-value=0.5099$) failed to reject the null hypothesis that the two population means are equal. On the other hand, the vertical distribution of faunal remains recovered from the UA4 unit is comparable with that of the \emph{Elephas} ($p-value=0.6562$).
Nevertheless, the density functions altogether clearly confirm one of the main observations assessed during excavation, namely that the elephant remains and most of the recovered faunal and lithic material in Area A lie at or close to the UA3c/4 contact, with unit UA3c covering the remains.

  \label{fig:7}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Area B}

%% UB5a
Fig.~\ref{fig:8} shows the empirical density functions of the minimum distances from each specimen from Area B to the UB4c/5a erosional contact (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b). The combined distribution of any type of find from the UB5a unit (Fig.~\ref{fig:8}a) skewed to the left with a short tail (up to -0.3~m). The mode, between 5 and 10~cm below the roof of UB5a, indicates a general concentration of material very close to the contact of this unit with the overlying UB4c, in accordance with the mean distribution of the different classes of remains. % Moreover, the analysis of variance ($F=, p-value=$) suggests, despite the small sample size, non-significant difference between them. But normality assumption is not satisfied... --> F less than 1 means that the within groups variability is higher than variability between groups. The larger the population effect size is (in combination with sample size), the more the F distribution will move to the right, and the less likely we will be to get a value less than one.
Although the majority of both the lithic and faunal assemblages were found in the uppermost 15~cm of UB5a, few debris/chips and bone fragments occur lower in the sequence, yet no more than 30~cm below the roof of this unit. Very few flakes, three tools and no cores have been found in this unit. As a whole, the lithic assemblage from UB5a, mostly composed by debris/chips, is only 7\% of the most conspicuous assemblage from UB4c.

%% UB4c
The global distribution of unit UB4c was right skewed (up to almost 0.6~m) and centred at about 5~cm above the contact with the underlying unit UB5a (Fig.~\ref{fig:8}b). Almost 30\% of the sample fell exactly at the erosional contact that separates UB4c from UB5a. The density estimations of the lithic debris/chip, flakes, tools and faunal remains significantly overlap, whereas the distribution of the six cores shows a bimodal shape with peaks at 5 and 20~cm above the contact. However, the Welch Two Sample t-test of the lithic and faunal sample means failed to reject the null hypothesis ($p-value=0.6295$). % The ANOVA $F$ statistic ($F=5.872, p-value=0.000563$) reject the null hypothesis that the mean outcome is the same across these groups. But normality assumption is not satisfied...

\subsection{Point pattern analysis}

%% Intro
Results of the point pattern analysis are complementary to those obtained from the analysis of the vertical and fabric distributions.  

%\subsubsection{Area A}

Regarding Area A, kernel density estimation and three-dimensional functions were applied in order to quantitatively depict the spatial distribution of the lithic assemblage in relation to the elephant skeleton.

Fig.~\ref{fig:9}a shows the smoothing kernel intensity estimation of the combined lithic and faunal assemblage from the UA3c unit. Contour lines delimit the density of the lithic sample. The partial skeleton of the \emph{E. (P.) antiquus} is superimposed on it. A preliminary visual examination of the plot suggests a homogeneous distribution of lithics (mostly debris/chips) and fossils. Spots of higher density appear to be spread around and in association with the elephant remains.

The univariate pair correlation function of the joined lithic assemblage from the UA3c and UA4 units (Fig.~\ref{fig:9}b) suggests aggregation of finds. The estimated $\hat{g}_3(r)$ function (black solid line) wanders above the benchmark value (red dotted line) until values of $r=0.8$. However, for distances between 35 and 65~cm, it lies above the grey envelope of significance for the null hypothesis of CSR, indicating that at those distances artefacts occur closer than expected in the case of random processes. For values of $r>0.8$, the function stabilises at values close to 0, suggesting a Poisson distribution. The plot illustrates the random distribution of finds between patches of clusters that we observe in the kernel density estimation (Fig.~\ref{fig:9}a).

The histogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:9}c shows the density of the distances calculated from each artefact to the nearest-neighbour elephant remain. A right skewed distribution, with a prevalent peak at 10~cm and mean $\mu$ 30~cm is an indication of the relatively strong aggregation of events around the mass of the elephant skeleton.

  \label{fig:9}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Area B}

As for Area B, the analysis first focused on the spatial distribution and cross-correlation of the assemblages from UB4c and UB5a (Fig.~\ref{fig:10}); and secondly on the interaction between classes of remains from UB4c (Fig.~\ref{fig:11}).

Figs.~\ref{fig:10}a,b respectively show kernel density estimations of the combined lithic and faunal assemblages from both the units analysed. Despite the samples size difference, a first visual examination suggests the presence of interesting spatial structures.

Regarding the UB4c unit (Fig.~\ref{fig:10}a), the high density of material concentrated around the western square 934/600 suggests that the pattern could have been the result of an inhomogeneous, non-uniform depositional process. Visual comparison of the density plot with the elevation model of the erosional contact between the UB4c and UB5a units (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b) suggests positive correlation between lower elevations (topographic depressions) and higher density of remains. Fig.~\ref{fig:10}c shows the results of the $\rho$-function, which estimates the intensity of the UB4c sample assemblage as a function of the covariate underlying topography created by the erosional event. Within the range of elevation between 350.2 and 350.4~m, the occurrence of finds is higher and the intensity decreases with the rise of elevation, i.e., finds are more likely to be found at lower elevations than would be expected if the intensity was constant.

Spatial Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Berman's $Z_2$ \citep{Berman1986} statistics were used in order to test the dependence of the UB4c pattern on the covariate erosional surface. Both KS ($D=0.11952$, $p-value=7.772e-16$) and $Z_2$ ($Z2=-7.8447$, $p-value=4.34e-15$) significantly rejected the null hypothesis of CSR. Although the tests suggested evidence that the intensity depends on the covariate, the effect of the covariate is weak and it seems to have no discriminatory power. The ROC curve and AUC statistics (0.56), which measure the strength of the covariate effect, suggest that the underlying UB4c/5a topography does not completely explain the localised high density of occurrence in the UB4c.

Relative spatial segregation seems to occur between the assemblages from UB4c (Fig.~\ref{fig:10}a) and UB5a (Fig.~\ref{fig:10}b), with high density of the former distribution corresponding to low density of the latter. The former analysis of the vertical distribution showed that the two assemblages occur very close to their stratigraphic contact. In order to further investigate the spatial interaction between the two depositional events, we applied multitype pair correlation ($g_{ij}(r)$) and nearest-neighbour ($G_{ij}(r)$) functions.

Fig.~\ref{fig:10}d shows the estimated values of the multivariate $\hat{g}_{ij}(r)$ function against the envelope of the null hypothesis, obtained by randomly shifting the position of remains from the two distributions in 199 Monte Carlo simulations. For fixed values of $r$ less than 30~cm the observed function lies below the benchmark value of independence, thus indicating segregation; but it wanders at the lower edge of the grey envelope. For fixed distances of $r>0.3$~m the observed and theoretical lines significantly overlap. Overall, the function suggests independence of the two point processes (UB4c and UB5a) at multiple scales.

However, the estimated $\hat{G}_{ij}(r)$ function (Fig.~\ref{fig:10}c), running well below the significance grey envelope for fixed values of $r>0.3$~m, confirms that the nearest-neighbour distances between remains from UB4c and UB5a are significantly longer than expected in the case of independent processes. Interestingly, at values of $r<0.2$~m the observed function failed to reject the null hypothesis of Complete Spatial Randomness and Independence (CSRI).

With the aim to integrate the vertical distribution analysis, the particle size spatial distribution of remains from the UB4c unit were investigated by means of a derivative of the multitype $K$-function, randomly labelling the classes of remains. Fig.\ref{fig:11} shows a selection of the array of possible combinations between classes. In any panel, the estimated function wanders above the benchmark value. Such positive deviations from the null hypotheses suggest that debris/chips are more likely to be found close to the other class of remains than would be expected in case of a completely random distribution. Permutating the lithic debris/chips with flakes (Fig.\ref{fig:11}a), tools (Fig.\ref{fig:11}b), cores (Fig.\ref{fig:11}c) and faunal remains (Fig.\ref{fig:11}d), the Monte Carlo test results would have been significantly consistent with clustering, if we had chosen distance values $r > 0.4$, $r > 0.4$, $r > 0.9$, $r > 0.8$, respectively. Conversely, we could not reject the null hypothesis of CSRI for lesser values of $r$.

\section{Discussion}

%% Intro
Recent excavations at the Middle Pleistocene site of Marathousa~1 have unearthed in one of the two investigated areas (Area A) a partial skeleton of a single individual of \emph{Elephas (P.) antiquus}, whose bones are in close anatomical association, and spatially and stratigraphically associated with lithic artefacts and other faunal remains. In Area B, 60~m to the South of Area A, we collected a much higher number of lithic artefacts (Tourloukis et al., this issue), spatially and stratigraphically associated with other faunal remains, including isolated elephant bones, cervids and carnivores among others (Konidaris et al., this issue).

The two areas are stratigraphically correlated, the main fossiliferous layers (UA3c and UB4c) representing a relatively low-energy depositional process, such as a hyperconcentrated flow that dumped material in a lake margin context (Karkanas et al., this issue).

To date, evidence of butchering (cut-marks) has been identified on two bones of the elephant skeleton from Area A, as well on elephant and other mammal bones from Area B (see Konidaris, this issue).

However, due to the secondary depositional nature of the main fossiliferous horizon, it is of primary importance to evaluate the degree and reliability of the spatial association of the lithic artefacts with the faunal remains, and especially with the elephant skeleton. In order to tackle our main objective, we applied a comprehensive set of spatial statistics to the distributions of the archaeological and zooarchaeological/palaeontological remains from relevant stratigraphic units of the two areas of investigation. Results of our analyses are here discussed for both areas.

\subsection{Fabric analysis}

%% Assumptions:

%% Intro
The analysis of the orientation (dip and strike) of subsets of remains, mostly bone fragments, organic residues and lithic artefacts, showed different patterns for the two main find-bearing units.

%\subsubsection{UA4}

The test results (Tab.~\ref{tab:3}) for the UA4 sample and the sample of elephant remains - which lie on unit UA4 and are covered by UA3c - indicated significant preferential orientations towards the NE (Figs.~\ref{fig:4}b,c). As shown by the Woodcock's (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}) and the Benn's diagrams (Fig.~\ref{fig:6}), these samples plotted together at a distance from the others. Such convergence suggests that the elephant carcass, the other faunal remains and the organic material, deposited on unit UA4, were subject to the same processes.

Far from the isotropic corner in the Benn's diagram these two samples from Area A plotted approximately in between the linear and planar extremes, with the elephant sample showing a more planar fabric. When the results published by \cite{Bertran1997} and \cite{Lenoble2004} from observations of fabrics in modern subaereal slope deposits were used as a reference, the two samples aggregated well within the cluster of runoff process. Yet, they still plotted at the extreme margins of debris flow and relatively distant from the linear corner.

This result is consistent with the exposure of unit UA4 to overland water-laden processes that occurred before the flood event UA3/UB4 (Karkanas et al., this issue). Notably, the erosive nature of low-energy processes triggered by rain-water has been observed on lacustrine floodplains, and is associated with anisotropic patterns in autochthonous assemblages \citep{Cobo-Sanchez2014,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014,Garcia-Moreno2016}.

On the other hand, the fabric of the UA3c sample, being similar to those of the UB4c sub-samples (Figs.~\ref{fig:5} and~\ref{fig:6}), supports the stratigraphic correlation between these units across the two investigated areas. The fabric analysis suggests that the UA3/UB4 process can be categorized as a flood event, which falls in between the spectrum of debris and hyperconcentrated flow. Indeed, random distribution and orientation of clasts is expected for debris flows, except at flow margins, where preferential orientation and clusters of clasts have been observed \citep{Pierson2005}. %Eventually, such flood would have had the power to significantly reorient elements of the elephant carcass and slightly displace them.

Unlike bones with a tubular shape (i.e., long bones), ribs and vertebrae are prone to orient preferentially under high energy processes, less likely under low energy processes \citep{Dominguez-Rodrigo2013,Dominguez-Rodrigo2014}. Interestingly, whereas some of the ribs share the same preferential orientation with the long bones, others are oriented NW/SE. However, a NW/SE orientation could be consistent with a prevalent NE direction of the flow (and vice-versa), since long bones could roll orthogonally to the flow direction \citep{Voorhies1966}.

On the other hand, a higher energy flood would lead to an under-representation of most cancellous grease-bearing bones, which are prone to be easily transported by water induced processes \citep{Voorhies1966}. Yet several carpals, tarsals, metapodials, phalanges, ribs and vertebrae are present and in close spatial association with the elephant cranium and other skeletal elements.

The presence of many of the skeletal elements suggests that the elephant carcass was not subjected to high energy processes. Thus, we can assume that relatively low energy overland flows slightly reworked and oriented the exposed elements of the already dismembered (and probably already marginally displaced) elephant carcass, which mostly preserves close anatomical associations, but not anatomical connections.

%\subsubsection{UA3c/UA4c}

In Area B, two sub-samples from the same stratigraphic unit were analysed, according to the different methods used for recording the orientation (dip and strike) of the finds (i.e., 'clock' vs. compass), mostly faunal remains, wood fragments and lithic artefacts. Due to the different shapes of the two distributions (Figs.~\ref{fig:4}d,e), test statistics reported contrasting results (Tab.~\ref{tab:3}). Indeed, the clock system, recording non-continuous circular data, tends to produce a distribution more subject to show a multimodal shape when the distribution is actually uniform. However, the three-dimensional Woodcock (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}) and Benn (Fig.~\ref{fig:6}) diagrams agreed upon assessing the randomness of the samples. Despite minor differences between the two samples, both plotted with the UA3c sample in the reference range of debris flows.

\subsection{Vertical distribution}

%% Assumption: We provisionally assume that a general concentration of unsorted material in the proximity of the erosional surfaces would support an endogenous/autochthonous origin of the assemblages; whereas a poor to extremely poorly sorted and homogenous vertical distribution of remains from the UA3c and UB4c units would suggest an exogenous origin and a subsequent secondary deposition trigged by a massive process, e.g., debris or hyperconcentrated flows. Graded bedding could result in such fluid depositional environments, associated with a decrease in transport energy.

% fluid depositional environments, where there is a decrease in transport energy over time, the bedding material will be sorted more uniformly according to the normal grading scale. As water or air slows down, the turbidity decreases. The suspended load of the detritus will precipitate. In times of fast movement the bedding may be poorly sorted on the deposition surface and thus will not be normally graded because of the high energy movement of the material. In broad channels with decreasing slopes, turbid water can carry large amounts of detritous over a large area. Thus, graded beds form at points with decreased slopes in wide areas with less bounding of energy current flows. The energy is dispersed and decreases. Turbid sediments will precipitate in concordant sizes and shapes in layers.[5]

%% Ref:

%% Intro
As for the vertical distribution, we assume that mass wasting processes, such as debris or hyperconcentrated flows, would predominantly distribute extremely poorly sorted clasts homogeneously throughout the sequence. Normal or inverse grading can be observed in such flows \citep{Pierson2005}. A concentration of unsorted elements in the proximity of the erosional surface, as well as the absence of any grading, would in turn suggest an autochthonous assemblage.

%\subsubsection{Area A}

The lithic assemblage from Area A - the combined sample from units UA3c and UA4 ($n = 54$), composed by a few debitage products and a relatively high number of debris/chips and retouch waste products (Tab.~\ref{tab:2}) - plotted predominantly in the proximity of the erosional surface created by the UA3/UB4 event. The faunal remains from unit UA3c resemble the distribution of the archaeological assemblage as a whole; whereas the ones from the underlying unit UA4 match the vertical distribution of the elephant (Fig.~\ref{fig:7}).

Overall, the material recovered from unit UA3c did not show any grading and mainly plotted at the bottom of the unit, thus is consistent with the hypothesis of an autochthonous assemblage.

%\subsubsection{Area B}

In Area B, two samples from units UB4c ($n = 1243$) and UB5a ($n = 101$) respectively, were analysed (Tab.~\ref{tab:2}) for quantifying the minimum orthogonal distance of each item to the modelled erosional surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b).

The vertical distribution of lithic artefacts and fossils from unit UB4c showed a predominant peak right at the contact with the erosional surface. Almost 30\% of this rich sample plotted at a distance between 0 and 5~cm from the erosional contact; whereas the rest gently skewed to the upper part of the unit, up to about 50~cm. The same distribution was observed for all classes of remains, suggesting no size sorting and an origin very close to the erosional surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:8}b).

The density distribution of the sample from the underlying UB5a unit (Fig.~\ref{fig:8}a) globally indicates a more constrained vertical displacement of remains (within 30~cm below the erosional surface). Whereas lithic artefacts and fossils mostly plot right at the contact and just below it, a few debris/chips and faunal remains were found lower in the sequence. No size sorting was observed, but, notably, lithic cores are absent and the debris/chip distribution is wider than the distribution of the few flakes and tools.

Field observations of cracks in the clayey UB5a unit testify to shrinking and swelling during wet and dry cycles (Karkanas et al., this issue), which suggests that vertical displacement of some small lithics and fossil fragments at lower depths with respect to the UB5a/4c contact probably resulted from clay desiccation.

Likewise, \cite{Lenoble2004} documented up to 30~cm vertical dispersion and frequent vertical dip of artefacts from the marshy silty clay of the Croix-de-Canard site, sector 3.

Furthermore, a recent experimental study of animal trampling in water saturated substrates reported negative correlation with artefact size, significant inclination and greater vertical displacement than any former work: a maximum between 16 and 21~cm, with a mean of about 6~cm \citep{Eren2010}.

The fact that the majority of the remains from units UB4c and UB5a plotted at, or very close to the contact between these two layers, the relatively high percentage of lithics in both units, as well as the absence of size sorting or grading, suggest autochthonous assemblages, deposited in UB5a and subsequently eroded \emph{in situ} by the UA3/UB4 flood event.

% consider a separate and independent origin for the sediments and the archaeological materials

\subsection{Point pattern analysis}

%% Assumptions:
% Complete spatial randomness (CSR) would suggest that the pattern most probably is the result of a random process, such as an high energy mass movement. On the other hand, different biotic and/or natural processes could produce clustering or segregation of the lithic artifacts. Spatial aggregation, if not triggerd by obstractions, would conventionally support an in-situ primary origin of the assemblage.
% A prevalence of short distances would indicate aggregation of the lithic artifacts about the mass of the elephant carcass; whereas an uniform or simmetric distribution would support random independent processes.

% Complete spatial randomness and independence (CSRI) of the two processes would support an exogenous origin hypothesis of the assemblage recoverd from the UB4c unit. On the other hand, positive or negative association can be interpreted as expression of different endogenous processes.
% Like for the vertical distribution, horizontal clustering of the debris/chip portion of the assemblage with other dimensional classes of remains would suggest the lack of sorting by natural depositional processes.

%% Ref:

%% Intro
The hypothesis that in both areas the lithic and faunal assemblages were primarily deposited \emph{in situ} and were subsequently reworked by a low energy flood, was further explored by means of point pattern analysis.

We assumed that a completely random spatial distribution of the lithic artefacts and faunal remains would suggest an allochthonous origin and subsequent transport to the site by the action of a random massive process, such as debris flow. Nevertheless, clustering of artefacts is not necessarily evidence of human presence. Aggregation or segregation patterns could be produced by a range of biotic and/or natural processes. Human activities, topography and physical obstructions alike could trigger spatial aggregation.

%\subsubsection{Area A}

The three-dimensional distribution of lithic artefacts from unit UA3c shows significant clustering for values of $r$ between 35 and 65~cm. Lithic artefacts occur relatively close to the skeletal elements of the elephant, at a distance between 20 and 50~cm at most (Fig.~\ref{fig:9}). The richest cluster of about 20 lithic artefacts is located to the SW of the cranium, close to the right femur and the scatter of ribs and vertebrae.

Considering the prevalent NE orientation of the elephant bones and the other faunal remains from UA4, it is not unlikely that a SW/NE oriented flood could have been responsible for the observed accumulation to the SW of the elephant cranium, which would have represented an important obstruction to the flow. A similar case of clustering of small remains, apparently dammed by a long elephant tusk, has also been observed at Castel di Guido (Italy) \citep{Boschian2010}. Secondary deposition by low-energy flows and clustering of artefacts and bones blocked by an aurochs carcass have been as well documented at the site of 'Ein Qashishadd (Israel) \citep{Hovers2014}.

As mentioned above, whereas fairly random fabric and spatial distribution of coarse clasts are observed at the centre of modern debris flow deposits, preferential orientation and clustering may occur at the margin of the flood \citep{Pierson2005}. Yet the fabric analysis of the UA3c sample shows a random distribution, which falls within the range of debris flow (Fig.~\ref{fig:6}), and the pair correlation function (Fig.~\ref{fig:9}b) suggests significant clustering of lithic artefacts at relatively small scale: a pattern less likely to be produced by a large scale massive process such as a debris flow. Moreover, clusters of lithic artefacts occur as well in areas with lower densities of elephant bones.

%% Reverse summary of evidences
Small scale clustering; proximity to the elephant remains and the erosional surface; absence of spatial size sorting and, on the contrary, the presence of a relatively high number of lithic debris/chips associated with some flakes and tools; close anatomical spatial association of the elephant skeletal elements, slightly displaced and preferentially oriented: these lines of evidences support the hypothesis of an autochthonous deposition, subject to localised minor reworking.

%\subsubsection{Area B}

A similar pattern can be observed in Area B, where an initial set of spatial statistics confirmed that the inhomogeneous density of remains from unit UB4c (Fig.~\ref{fig:10}a) is not completely explained by the covariate effect of the underlying complex topography created by the erosional event UA3/UB4 (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}b).

Thus, we explored the relative spatial interaction between the UB4c and the underlying UB5a samples. We assumed that complete spatial randomness of the two independent depositional processes would occur in case of an exogenous origin and transportation of the UB4c assemblage. The hypothesis of an autochthonous original deposition of the faunal and lithic assemblages on the UB5a unit, subsequently eroded \emph{in situ} by a relatively high energy flood (UB4c), was tested by cross-pattern spatial correlation functions (Figs.~\ref{fig:10}d,e). Whereas the two samples are vertically adjacent to the erosional surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:8}), on the horizontal plane they are both more segregated than expected for a random distribution.

Moreover, for the UB4c sample, an unsorted particle size spatial distribution was confirmed (Fig.~\ref{fig:11}). The occurrence in the same place of small and large classes of remains suggests that post-depositional processes, such as water winnowing, have not severely affected the assemblage. Hyperconcentrated flows would have dumped material onto the lake margin. In this way, particles would have been frozen and deposited \emph{en mass}. Hence their non-sorted spatial distribution.

%% Reverse summary of evidences
Conversely, the extraordinary preservation and number of mint to sharp, unsorted lithic artefacts from the UB4c unit; their density, positively correlated to the topography, and significantly segregated from the underlying distribution of remains; the vertical proximity of both assemblages from UB4c and UB5a to the erosional surface; as well as the random orientation pattern of the former, suggest that significant displacement of materials due to the erosional event can be excluded.

The faunal and lithic assemblages from unit UB4c therefore most likely derived from the local erosion of exposed mudflat areas (UB5a layer) and have been slightly redistributed by the same flood event that capped the elephant in Area A.

%% Refitting analysis?
Further evidence that the recovered assemblage has not undergone substantial reworking and has retained its original characteristics would come from the refitting analysis, currently in progress. To date, 4 bone refits have been found in Area B: three from unit UB4c, respectively at 4.77, 0.05 and 0.01~m distance; and one between two mammal bone fragments from units UB4c and UB5a, at a very short distance (0.09~m). Interestingly, one of the elements of the most distant refit (a \emph{Dama sp.} mandibular fragment) shows traces of carnivore gnawing (Konidaris et al., this issue).

%% What can we reliably infere about site formation processes at Marathousa 1?
In conclusion, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the erosional event UB4/UA3 represents a relatively low-energy process in the continuum between debris and hyperconcentrated flow, which would have locally reworked at a small scale the already exposed or slightly buried and spatially associated lithic and faunal assemblages.

%% What can we reliably infere about past human behaviour at Marathousa 1?
Although the UB4/UA3 process represents a snapshot of a relatively short time-frame, inferences about the use of space by human groups, in terms of knapping episodes and butchering activities, are unreliable in light of the current information.

The spatial pattern observed at the site is indeed the result of the last episode in a palimpsest of spatial processes. Whereas the erosional event represented by the debris/hyperconcentrated flow UA3/UB4 caps the sequence and preserves the record, little is known about the eroded underlying occupational horizon.

However, whereas hunting or scavenging is still an unsolved matter of debate, considering the rate of bone fragmentation, the density of lithic debris/chips, the number of processed bones and their spatial density and association, it is likely that the assemblage represents a complex palimpsest of locally repeated events of hunting/scavenging and exploitation of lake shore resources. % A model of 'rapid-accumulation palimpsest' \cite[sensu][p.89]{Malinski-Buller2011} of "multiple, temporally sequential depositional episodes, caused independently by humans and/or non-human agents"

More data from high resolution excavations in the coming years will allow us to refine the coarse-grained spatio-temporal resolution of our inferences about past human behaviour at Marathousa~1.

\section{Conclusions}

%% Recall the site
At the Middle Pleistocene open-air site of Marathousa~1, a partial skeleton of a single individual of \emph{Elephas (Palaeoloxodon) antiquus} was recovered in stratigraphic association with a rich and consistent lithic assemblage and other vertebrate remains. Cut-marks and percussion marks have been identified on the elephant and other mammal bones excavated at the site. The main find-bearing horizon represents a secondary depositional process in a lake margin context.

%% Recall the main aims of the study
Understanding the site formation processes is of primary importance in order to reliably infer hominin exploitation of the elephant carcass and other animals. To meet this aim, we applied a comprehensive set of multivariate and multiscale spatial analyses in a taphonomic framework.

%% Recall the preliminary results
Results from the fabric, vertical distribution and point pattern analyses are consistent with a relatively low-energy erosional process slightly reworking at a small scale an exposed (or slightly buried) and consistent scatter of lithic artefacts and faunal remains. These results are in agreement with preliminary taphonomic observations of the lithic artefacts (Tourloukis et al., this issue) and the faunal remains (Konidaris et al., this issue), which also indicate minor weathering and transportation. Our analyses show that multiple lines of evidence support an autochthonous origin of the lithic and faunal assemblages, subject to minor post-depositional reworking. Human activities therefore took place on-site, during an as of yet uncertain range of time.
