Here, we present a spatial taphonomic approach to the understanding of post-depositional processes affecting experimental assemblages modified by fluvial currents. Spatial statistical methods are a great tool to understand how different taphonomic variables relate at a spatial scale. The results of the application of this method to bone assemblages affected by low- and high-energy flows show the loss or modification of most of the original spatial taphonomic relationships. It also shows the degree of bone loss according to element, anatomical section and bone structure, and shape types. Anisotropy is identified in both experimental contexts. These results add new criteria to assess the impact of water flows in bone assemblages and contribute to define the properties of lag assemblages.},

The Lazaret, Lunel Viel, Fontbrégoua, Caminade, Ambrona and Grotta dei Moscerini occurrences are examined in detail. The adequacy and significance of samples and the value of the refitting method are discussed for some cases. The most successful interpretations of site function, behavioural patterns or models of cultural stratigraphy are those that integrate bone taphonomy or lithic analyses, whether or not based on refitting, with sedimentary and contextual analyses. Some occurrences show that taphonomy without contextual or stratigraphic controls is not likely to produce solid data and that honesty in inference requires that our interpretations do not imply more than we actually know. },

  abstract  = {Mudflow deposits in Permian rocks in Antarctica are used as examples to demonstrate that a computer model will differentiate these from other diamictites. Four A-axis fabrics were measured from the mudflow units and were found to be similar to long-axis fabrics produced by simulations. When compared with till fabrics from the same section the mudflow fabrics can be distinguished because of the presence of dipping girdles in the latter. Had the mudflows been arrested at a stage of maximum fabric development, it would be impossible to distinguish them from most till fabrics. C-axis fabrics developed in mudflows have vertical modes while their counterparts in till fabrics plunge steeply in a downstream direction.},
