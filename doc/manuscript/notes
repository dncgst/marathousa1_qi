%% Hypothesis testing
Two contrasting hypotheses are tested: the autochthonous model \citep[][sensu]{Dominguez-Rodrigo2012} states that the flow event, represented by units UA3c and UB4c, eroded and scoured the exposed surface (where the elephant was lying), thereby entraining clastic material (including artefacts) and re-depositing \citep[][sensu]{Fernandez-Lopez} this material at a close distance. This model implies the loss of any original, pristine spatial relations between remains, but minor transport from the primary depositional \emph{loci}. On the other hand, the allochthonous model \citep[][sensu]{Dominguez-Rodrigo2012} implies significant transport from the original \emph{loci} of deposition and re-elaboration \citep[][sensu]{Fernandez-Lopez}. According to this model, the spurious spatial association between the lithic artefacts and faunal remains does not support any behavioural interpretation.

AUTOCHTHONOUS model: random, chaotic process erode in situ material
-vertical distribution concentrated around the erosional surface
-original fabric randomized by the mass process
-non-random spatial distribution (produced by humans or other processes before the mass event)
-no size sorting, produed by humans
-size sorting produced by winnowing before mass process
-non-random spatial dependence (better segregation) with the underlying units

ALLOCHTHONOUS model: random, chaotic, mass process
-homogeneous/random vertical distribution throughout the sequence (but grading can occur with decreasing energy)
-random fabric (but more linear at the margin?)
-random spatial distribution of material
-no size sorting (but bigger,heavier material at the margin?)
-random spatial dependence with the underlying unit

Resultant deposit may exhibit diagnostic inverse grading \citep{Lowe1982}, or a continuously aggrading bed \citep{Sohn1997}.



NOTES on floods
---------------

flood: overbank flow (hyperconcentrated flow, water flow)

DEBRIS FLOW: commonly occur in small steep watersheds during intense rainstorm
* sand and fine gravel grains tipically angular to subangular
* coarse-clast distribution fairly random in centers of deposit surfaces, but accumulations of coarse clasts at margins
* no gravel imbrication
* nonstratified, extremely poorly sorted
* normal and/or inverse grading common in vertical section
* clasts oriented randomly, except at flow margins
- may be followed by recessional hyperconcentrated flow or water flow

HYPERCONCENTRATED FLOW
WATER FLOW
* most grains are rounded to subrounded
* water flow sediments usually stratified
* in water flow abrupt changes in mean grain size, sorting moderate to good within individual bedding units
* in hyperconcentrated flow, sorting usually poor to very poor, textural changes usually not abrupt
*

HYPER:
Poorly sorted and weakly 
stratified to massive; thin 
gravel lenses; clast supported; 
normal and reverse grading



{Lenoble2004}
* mudslides in the linear corner. periglacial
solifluction and mudslides give the highest values of
fabric strength.
* Isotropic fabrics are found mainly
within rockfall screes, snow avalanche deposits and the
frontal lobes of debris flows
* overland flow (runoff) mostly generates planar fabrics

{Bertran1997}
Debris flows can be defined as rapid mass move-
ments of poorly sorted solids and water. The fabric of debris flow deposits shows
analogies to that of solifluction deposits. Most
authors found clast orientations parallel to the
slope direction. Oblique and transverse orientations
of clasts have occasionally been reported, the
former particularly from the lateral levees and
lobes, and the latter mainly from the lobe fronts
The fabric strength is, however, often lower
than in solifluction deposits.

'hyper-concentrated flows' (Pierson & Costa, 1987),are transitional between debris flows and
bedload transport.
