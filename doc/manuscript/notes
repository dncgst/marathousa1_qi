allochthonous VS autochthonous

ALLOCHTHONOUS model: random, chaotic, mass process
-homogeneous/random vertical distribution throughout the sequence (but grading can occur with decreasing energy)
-random fabric (but more linear at the margin?)
-random spatial distribution of material
-no size sorting (but bigger,heavier material at the margin?)
-random spatial dependence with the underlying unit

AUTOCHTHONOUS model: random, chaotic process erode in situ material
-vertical distribution concentrated around the erosional surface
-original fabric randomized by the mass process
-non-random spatial distribution (produced by humans or other processes before the mass event)
-no size sorting, produed by humans
-size sorting produced by winnowing before mass process
-non-random spatial dependence (better segregation) with the underlying units
